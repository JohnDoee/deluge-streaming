# Streaming Plugin
https://github.com/JohnDoee/deluge-streaming

(c)2016 by Anders Jensen <johndoee@tidalstream.org>

## Description

This plugin adds a new entry to the file list context menu that enables
the user to stream a file using HTTP.

Technically, it tries to download the part of a file the user requests and
downloads ahead, this enables seeking in video files.

## Where to download

You can download this release on Github. Look for the "releases" tab on the repository page.
Under that tab, eggs for Python 2.6 and 2.7 should exist.

## How to use

* Install plugin
* Select a torrent
* Select _files_ tab
* Right-click a file.
* Click _Stream this file_
* Select the link, open it in a media player, e.g. VLC or MPC

If you want to stream from a non-local computer, e.g. your seedbox, you will need to change the IP in option to the external server ip.

## Open directly in your video player

By using a small tool it is possible to it's possible to open streams directly in VLC or another media player.

* Download and install [StreamProtocol](http://streamprotocol.tidalstream.org/)
* Go into Deluge Streaming options and enable "Use stream protocol urls"
* Optional, if you want to skip the popup and open streams directly when ready, enable "Auto-open stream protocol urls"

## Motivation

The plugin is not meant to be used as a right-click to stream thing. The idea is to
make Deluge an abstraction layer for the [Tidalstream](http://www.tidalstream.org/) project, i.e. torrents to http on demand.

The _allow remote_ option is to allow remote add and stream of torrents.

## Todo

* [ ] Better feedback in interface about streams
* [ ] Better feedback when using API
* [ ] Fix problems when removing torrent from Deluge (sea of errors)

# HTTP API Usage

## Prerequisite

Install and enable the plugin. Afterwards, head into Streaming settings and enable "Allow remote control".
The URL found in the "Remote control url" field is where the API can be reached. The auth used is Basic Auth.

## Usage

There is only one end-point and that is where a torrent stream can be requested.

Both return the same responses and all responses are JSON encoded.
All successfully authenticated responses have status code 200.

## POST /streaming/stream

POST body must be the raw torrent you want to stream. No form formatting or anything can be used.

List of URL GET Arguments

* **path**: Path inside the torrent file to either a folder or a file you want to stream. The plugin will try to guess the best one. **Optional**. **Default**: '' (i.e. find the best file in the whole torrent)
* **infohash**: Infohash of the torrent you want to stream, can make it a bit faster as it can avoid reading POST body. **Optional**.
* **label**: If label plugin is enabled and the torrent is actually added then give the torrent this label. **Optional**. **Default**: ''
* **wait_for_end_pieces**: Wait for the first and last piece in the streamed file to be fully downloaded. Can be necessary for some video players. It also enforces that the torrent can be actually downloaded. If the key exist with any (even empty) value, the feature is enabled. **Optional**. **Default**: false

## GET /streaming/stream

* **infohash**: Does the same as when POSTed. **Mandatory**.
* **path**: Does the same as when POSTed. **Optional**.
* **wait_for_end_pieces**: Does the same as when POSTed. **Optional**.

## Success Response

```json
{
    "status": "success", # Always equals this
    "filename" "horse.mkv", # Filename of the streamed torrent
    "url": "http://example.com/" # URL where the file can be reached by e.g. a media player
}
```

## Error Response

```json
{
    "status": "error", # Always equals this
    "message" "Torrent failed" # description for why it failed
}
```
